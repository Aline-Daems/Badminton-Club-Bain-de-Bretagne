# Badminton-Club-Bain-de-Bretagne

This forum is a small PHP project in order for our group to learn PHP, SQL and the free heroku web hosting service.

The site is available here : http://badminton-club-bb.herokuapp.com/

It is splitted in multiple subsections for which we used a particular terminology :
    * A catagory called "board" contains "forums" which contain "topics" containing "posts".

The forum meets the features a classical forum have :
    * user system and profile management
    * possibility to add posts to an existing topic
    * possibility to create new topics
